                            <h4>Buyers</h4>
                            <h5>Q: I have not received my order yet? What should I do next? </h5>
                            <p>A: Please try to track your order to know the shipping status. You can also contact the seller for more info. If you get no reply from the seller, you can open a dispute to get a refund. It is important that you should open a dispute before the Buyer Protection period ends.</p>
                            <h5>Q: The payment method I am using is not available. What should I do? </h5>
                            <p>A: There is a possibility that the payment provider you are using is experiencing technical issues. We suggest you use another payment method or you can try again later.</p>
                            <h5>Q: Why is my order status saying Awaiting Payment?</h5>
                            <p>A: Generally, it can take up to 7 business days for us to receive your payment after you wire transfer. For payments by Western Union, the processing time is 3 business days. So, we urge you to please wait or contact us if the issue remains unresolved.</p>
                            <h5>Q: When will I receive my refund? </h5>
                            <p>A: Generally, it can take 3-15 business days for buyers to receive a refund.</p>
                            <h5>Q: Why was my order closed? </h5>
                            <p>A: Your order closed due to the following two scenarios:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>- The discount or coupon has been used by the same user</li>
                                    <li>- The information you provided is incomplete. </li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h5>Q: I want to cancel an order, what should I do?</h5>
                            <p>A: Please keep in mind that the order that is not shipped yet can be canceled. You have to cancel the order with the seller's approval.</p>
